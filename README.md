# Encumbrance

Carrying items past your player's hotbar is now a burden to movement. Jumping, attacking, grappling, or mounting in such conditions may cause your items to randomly drop. Additionally, movement will become increasingly sluggish with more item slots in use. Other configurable effects can be applied. Carrying capacity can also be configured.
